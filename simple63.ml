(* Each row in the table below is an encoding scheme. Each
   encoding scheme is associated with an integer tag whose
   (4-bit) value is in the range of [0,15]. An encoding scheme
   is itself a sequence of integers representing the bit widths of
   integers that are encoded within a single 63-bit word.

   Since an OCaml integer consists of 63 (not 64) bits, and a 4 bits tag
   is used to encode the identity of a word's scheme, 59 bits remain
   to encode anywhere from 1 to 59 integers. The following
   table offers a different view of the encoding schemes associated
   with each tag. As with the previous table, each scheme is represented by
   a row in the table:

   These schemes were designed so that the following property holds:
   Consider a sequence of integers that can plausibly be encoded by a
   scheme whose tag is T. Any prefix of that sequence (some leading
   subsequence) can be encoded by at least one other scheme whose
   tag T' >= T.

   For example, consider a sequence of 5 integers that can be
   encoded by the scheme tag:11. A prefix of length 3 of that sequence
   could be encoded by the scheme tag:12 (whose capacity is 4 integers),
   and the scheme tag:13 (whose capacity is exactly 3 integer). The
   scheme tag:14 is not valid for that prefix, because that scheme can
   only accomodate two integers.
